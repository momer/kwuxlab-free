# Test inventory
#
# Consul membership is at the basis of our topology, and
# our "all hosts" (kwuxlab) group is composed of the "child" consul groups,
# as all nodes are expected to have consul installed on the host.
#
# Note: each host is associated with a `target_hostname` which will be the
# DNS location of the node via tailscale!
#
# For details on the Vagrant configuration, check out the Vagrantfile.
